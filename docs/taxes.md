**ATOS Tax Numbers Are Good-Faith Estimates Only!**

ATOS is not tax software, I am not an accountant, and I don't want to be one.

ATOS is not a substitute for real tax software or the advice of a financial professional.

All tax estimates are good faith estimates, but I can't make any guarantees of accuracy. Please use estimates only as a general guide for your tax obligations.

# Tax Files

The first step to estimating your taxes is to select or create your tax files.

You can find tax files at the [ATOS Modules repo](https://github.com/jbelelieu/atos_modules).

If you can't find what you need, you can use the sample files found at `modules/tax` as a guide.

All tax files need to be classified under the year they are relevant to.

For your convienience, I've included three example files for taxes at different region levels:

- USA: Federal
- USA: New York State
- USA: New York State: New York City

Please see the comment blocks on the various files for information on how to create your own. More information is also available in the modules repo.
