**ATOS Tax Numbers Are Good-Faith Estimates Only!**

ATOS is not tax software, I am not an accountant, and I don't want to be one.

ATOS is not a substitute for real tax software or the advice of a financial professional.

All tax estimates are good faith estimates, but I can't make any guarantees of accuracy. Please use estimates only as a general guide for your tax obligations.

# Setting Up Taxes

When you click on "Taxes" you will be prompted to setup your taxes for that year.

Once you've created the current year's taxes, you can change the year to any year you which to setup taxes for those years.

# Money Set Aside

Freelancers need to pay estimated taxes at regular intervals. Between those intervals, you will need to set your money aside somewhere. This helps you track how much you've set aside, and where you are keeping it. For example, you may have set aside $1,000 into your savings account, or perhaps you put that into a stock; "Money Set Aside" helps you track all of this.

# Tax Files

The first step to estimating your taxes is to select or create your tax files.

You can find tax files at the [ATOS Modules repo](https://github.com/jbelelieu/atos_modules).

If you can't find what you need, you can use the sample files found at `modules/tax` as a guide.

All tax files need to be classified under the year they are relevant to.

For your convienience, I've included three example files for taxes at different region levels:

- USA: Federal
- USA: New York State
- USA: New York State: New York City

Please see the comment blocks on the various files for information on how to create your own. More information is also available in the modules repo.
