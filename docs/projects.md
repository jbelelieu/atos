# Projects

Projects reflect any work being performed between a company you represent (the contractor), and a client you are working for.

When you create a project, you'll start with a "default collection". A default collection is where your "unorganized" tasks will live for the project. This can be seen as the "backlog" from which you will move tasks into an active colletion.

An "active collection" is required to bill out clients. Invoices are generated based on a collection of tasks.

## Project Links & Files

These are convenience tools to have all of your documents and important links for a project in one place.

You can view either by clicking the "Links" and "Files" links next to your project name.

# Collections

You can create a collection from the top of any project's page next to the "Unorganized" bubble.

You can create multiple collections as well. To switch between collections, simple click any collection bubble at the top of the page.

## Moving Stories Around

Next to each story's title you will find a series of icons. The first icon on each row moves the story around. Rules for moving a story are simple:

- If the story is in the default collection, it will be moved to "open",
- If the story is in "open", it will be moved to the default collection,
- If the story is in any other state, it will be moved to "open"

You can change tasks in bulk from "open" <> "default collection" using the checkboxes to the left of each story and clicking on "Move Selected"

The other icons represent a "Task Status". See below for details.

# Tasks

## Creating a Task

You can create a task from a project's main page.

## Task Status

-  You can manage these from "Settings"

Task status are extremely important in that they control the "state" of the task. Task status can be set to either (or neither) of these states:

- "Complete" states mean they are consider done.
- "Billable" states mean they will be included on invoices and count as income on tax estimations.

## Task Type

-  You can manage these from "Settings"

A task type is a general way of organizing tasks. For example, a "story" may be one type of task, but that may not be appropriate when you're logging hours against "meetings".

You can also use task types to control what appears on a [report](reports.md).

## Task Rate Type

-  You can manage these from "Settings"

Rate types represent a dollar value you charge for a single unit of work. For example, you may charge $100/hour for standard coding work but $125/hour for DevOps work. Alternatively, you may simply charge different rates per client for the same work; you can use rate types to manage all of this.
